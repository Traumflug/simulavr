Archiving hint: In late summer 2023, Github started to enforce 2FA (Two Factor
                Authentication), so I had to archive it before losing control
                over it.  See also https://github.com/Traumflug/simulavr/issues/14

                Traumflug, August 2023

Forking hint: Purpose of this fork is to add a number of features required for
              Teacup Firmware https://github.com/Traumflug/Teacup_Firmware
              These features weren't accepted upstream, so this reopitory has
              to stay for that purpose.  Simulating Teacup works just great
              and insights gained by doing so brought a lot of performance
              and quality improvements.  Awesome!
