 *
 * This header provides macros to embed simulator setup information into
 * a compiled ELF binary.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Add this somewhere at the root level of your AVR code:
 *
 *   #include "simulavr_info.h"
 *   SIMINFO_DEVICE("atmega644");
 *   SIMINFO_CPUFREQUENCY(F_CPU);
 *
 * Then link as usual, but add these linker flags to avr-gcc to prohibit
 * the linker from removing the info sections at the link stage:
 *
 *   -Wl,--section-start=.siminfo=0x900000
 *
 * The value choosen here to be 0x900000 can be choosen freely, but must
 * be above 0x840400, else it can conflict with program / eeprom / fuses /
 * lockbits / signature data, see ELFLoad() in src/avrreadelf.cpp, line 215ff.
 *
 * You also have to avoid the -Wl,--gc-sections flag, which unfortunately
 * increases binary size if you have unused functions.
 *
 * Having this done, running the ELF binary in the simulator will
 * automatically inform simulavr for which AVR variant and CPU frequency
 * the binary was built, making the corresponding command line parameters
 * obsolete. In case you give both, in-binary and CLI parameters, CLI
 * parameters take precedence.
 *
 * The really nice thing about this mechanism is, it doesn't alter the
 * executed binary at all. You can upload and run this on real hardware,
 * not a single byte of Flash memory or a single CPU cycle at runtime wasted.

/*
 * Create a serial in (Rx, to AVR) component. The the sent characters/bytes
 * will be taken from the given file. This component can be connected to the
 * same file as a serial out, if it's a special file like a real serial device
 * or a pipe. Connecting both to the same regular file will mess things up.
 *
 * Using "-" as file name means connecting to the console (stdin/stdout).
 *
 * The pin to connect is named by a 2-character string, where "E2" means
 * pin 2 on port E.
 *
 * Why a baud rate? Well, the component doesn't just write to the UART receive
 * register, but synthesizes actual serial signals on the pin, which in turn
 * should be interpreted by your AVR code. If your code sets a baud rate not
 * matching the one given here, serial communications won't work. Just like a
 * real serial device configured to work at 19200 baud won't work on a real
 * serial port set to something else.
 *
 * Other parameters are fixed to 8N1, which means 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
